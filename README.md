# HomeLab

Hi, my name is AbdulAlrhman Harb, but you can call me Abdul. I'm a Cyber Security professional with a passion for expanding my HomeLab and diving into side projects. I decided to share my journey here to make it easier for others to follow along without too much hassle.

## What Will I Be Doing?

I'll be exploring a lot of exciting things. One major project on my radar is recreating [DetectionLab] (https://github.com/clong/DetectionLab/). But first, I have a lot to learn! I'm using Proxmox on my gaming desktop and an old MacBook Pro that I had lying around. I'll do my best to make everything clear, but if something isn't, please open an issue and let me know. I'll do my best to fix it.

I might even venture into making some YouTube videosâ€”let's see how that goes!

# Disclaimer

I'm documenting how **I** do things as I learn. My methods might not be perfect or the best, but this is my learning process.


This is going to be fun :)
